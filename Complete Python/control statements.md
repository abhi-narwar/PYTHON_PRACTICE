## 📌 5. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to **make decisions** in a program.

---

### 🔹 if Statement
Used to execute code **only when a condition is true**.

#### Practice Questions:
1. Check if a number is positive.
2. Check if a number is greater than 100.
3. Check if a person is eligible to vote.
4. Check if a number is divisible by 5.
5. Print "Hello" if a number is non-zero.

---

### 🔹 if–else Statement
Used when we have **two conditions**.

#### Practice Questions:
6. Check whether a number is even or odd.
7. Check whether a number is positive or negative.
8. Find the greater number between two numbers.
9. Check whether a year is a leap year.
10. Check whether a number is divisible by both 3 and 7.

---

### 🔹 if–elif–else Statement
Used when there are **multiple conditions**.

#### Practice Questions:
11. Print grade based on marks.
12. Find the largest among three numbers.
13. Create a simple calculator.
14. Check type of triangle.
15. Check whether a character is vowel or consonant.

---

### 🔹 Nested if
An `if` statement inside another `if`.

#### Practice Questions:
16. Check login system (username and password).
17. Check if number is positive and even.
18. Check exam eligibility using age and marks.
19. Find largest of three numbers using nested if.
20. Check leap year using nested if.

## 🔁 6. Looping Statements

Loops are used to **repeat a block of code**.

---

### 🔹 for Loop
Used when the number of iterations is **known**.

#### Practice Questions:
21. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
22. Print even numbers from 1 to 50.
23. Print multiplication table of a number.
24. Find sum of first `n` natural numbers.
25. Print each character of a string.

---

### 🔹 while Loop
Used when the number of iterations is **not known**.

#### Practice Questions:
26. Print numbers from 10 to 1.
27. Find sum of digits of a number.
28. Reverse a number.
29. Count digits in a number.
30. Check whether a number is palindrome.

---

### 🔹 Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop.

#### Practice Questions:
31. Print star pattern.
32. Print number pattern.
33. Print square pattern.
34. Print multiplication tables from 1 to 5.
35. Print triangle pattern.

---

### 🔹 break Statement
Used to **stop the loop immediately**.

#### Practice Questions:
36. Stop loop when number becomes 5.
37. Find first multiple of 7 between 1 and 100.
38. Stop searching when element is found.
39. Exit loop if user enters negative number.
40. Stop loop when sum exceeds 100.

---

### 🔹 continue Statement
Used to **skip current iteration**.

#### Practice Questions:
41. Print numbers from 1 to 10 except 5.
42. Skip even numbers.
43. Skip vowels in a string.
44. Skip negative numbers in a list.
45. Skip multiples of 3.

---

### 🔹 pass Statement
Used as a **placeholder** when no action is required.

#### Practice Questions:
46. Use pass inside empty if block.
47. Use pass inside loop.
48. Create function using pass.
49. Write future logic using pass.
50. Demonstrate difference between pass and continue.
