# Python Data Types & Operators – Interview Answers

This document contains **interview-ready answers** for Python **Data Types** and **Operators**.

---

## 1. Data Types

### int
- `int` is used to store whole numbers.
- It does not contain decimal values.

**Example:** `10`, `-5`, `100`

---

### float
- `float` is used to store decimal numbers.
- It is used when precision is required.

**Example:** `3.14`, `99.5`

---

### complex
- `complex` data type stores numbers with real and imaginary parts.
- Imaginary part is represented by `j`.

**Example:** `2 + 3j`

---

### boolean (bool)
- `boolean` data type stores only two values: `True` or `False`.
- It is mainly used in conditions and decision making.

**Example:** `True`, `False`

---

### string (str)
- `string` is used to store text or characters.
- It is written inside single or double quotes.

**Example:** `"Python"`, `'Hello'`

---

### type() Function
- `type()` function is used to check the data type of a variable.

**Example:**  
`type(10)` → `<class 'int'>`

---

### Type Casting
- Type casting means converting one data type into another.
- Common functions are `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.

**Example:**  
Converting string to integer: `"10"` → `10`

---

## 2. Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

---

### Arithmetic Operators
- Used to perform mathematical operations.

**Examples:**  
`+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division), `%` (Modulus)

---

### Relational (Comparison) Operators
- Used to compare two values.
- Result is always `True` or `False`.

**Examples:**  
`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

---

### Logical Operators
- Used to combine multiple conditions.

**Operators:**  
`and`, `or`, `not`

---

### Assignment Operators
- Used to assign values to variables.

**Examples:**  
`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

---

### Membership Operators
- Used to check whether a value exists in a sequence like list or string.

**Operators:**  
`in`, `not in`

---

### Identity Operators
- Used to compare memory location of two objects.

**Operators:**  
`is`, `is not`

---

## Interview Conclusion
- **Data Types** define what kind of data a variable stores.
- **Operators** define what operation is performed on data.
- Python is easy to use because of simple syntax and built-in data types.
